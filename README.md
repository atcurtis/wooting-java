Wooting Keyboard in Java

This project is based upon the released sources at
https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-rgb-sdk
except that this implements a similar API in Java and there is a simple 
Java Swing GUI which demonstrates setting individual key colours with
a basic but functional graphical interface.
